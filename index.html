            <p class="justify"><i>The Lambda Calculator</i> is an interactive, graphical application to help students of
                natural language semantics practice derivations in the typed lambda calculus. It is designed for both 
                students and teachers, with modules for online classroom instruction, graded homework assignments, and self-guided
                practice. The primary function is to assist in the computation of natural language denotations up a syntactic tree
                in the style of Heim &amp; Kratzer (1998). To this end, the program detects common errors and attempts to provide
                intelligent feedback to the student user and a record of performance for the instructor.

            [The Calculator] covers most of the common ground of formal
            semantics and it is great fun using it, and the notation is
            compatible with many introductions to semantics, e.g. the book
            of Heim and Kratzer. Students working with that tool will love
            it and possibly fall in love with formal semantics of natural
            language. I always wanted to have such a tool for my teaching.

            I learned about the program toward the middle of the semester,
            but once I knew about and briefly tested it, I did not
            hesitate to introduce it to the class. [...] Had I known
            about the program before I prepared my syllabus for the class,
            I definitely would have designed my class so that we can make
            use of the program more extensively.  I would recommend PLC to
            anyone who is willing to explore some better ways to teach and
            learn the sometimes tedious and confusing work of lambda
            derivations.

            I wished it had already existed at the moment when I made my
            first steps in formal semantics; certainly, I would have
            learned  faster and easier. One can only master the lambda
            calculus (and formal linguistics in general) by getting one's
            hands dirty, that is, by experimenting and testing. The
            calculator provides students with hints and immediate feedback
            whether their proposed solution is correct or not.

            <p>
            I am very grateful for your having the Penn Lambda Calculator
            so generously available to teachers and students of Formal
            Semantics.  As an instructor of a graduate-level course using
            Heim &amp; Kratzer (1998), I can attest how invaluable this
            resource has been for both me and my students as well.  The
            lambda notation is not easy for students who, despite their
            linguistics training, are not familiar with the formal
            apparatus of set theory, propositional calculus and predicate
            logic.  As I teach to Spanish-speaking students, it adds to
            the inherent difficulty of the subject the fact that the
            textbooks and the exercises included are mostly in English.
            With the lambda calculator I can create exercises using
            lexicon (and instructions) in Spanish that allow my students
            to practice how to simplify lambda expressions and calculate
            the denotations of syntactic trees at home.  In the classroom
            it makes it possible to discuss problems that will take
            forever otherwise.

            <p>
            I found the Calculator especially helpful for the individual
            training of students during recitations. It allowed each of
            them to follow their own pace. Students were all very positive
            about using it mostly because it is an interactive tool and
            provides intelligent feedback. The course is based on the Heim
            and Kratzer 1998 textbook <i>Semantics in Generative
              Grammar</i> which makes the tool a very valuable asset not only
            because it is designed to accompany that textbook but also
            because the textbook itself puts an accent on practice and
            exercise for mastering the calculating techniques and
            internalizing the principles behind them. In short, this is an
            excellent pedagogical tool which I will continue using in my
            future work.

            <p>For Mac and Windows: just download and double-click to start.  If you are running OS X 10.7.5 (Mountain Lion) or later, you may
            need to temporarily relax your security settings to open the application, since it is not from the Mac App Store. In System
            Preferences > Security &amp; Privacy > General, set "Allow applications downloaded from:" to "Anywhere". After opening and
            quitting the app once, you may adjust the setting as you like. For Linux: start with <code>java -jar LambdaCalculator.jar</code>,
            but make sure you run it with Sun's Java, not GNU libgcj.  You can check which version you have with <code>java -version</code>.
            </p>
        
            <h5 id="java">Installing Java</h5>
            <p>Windows and Linux users will need to make sure they have the <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava">Java JRE</a> 1.6 or
                newer installed. The Windows version of the calculator will check on startup if Java is installed, and if necessary,
                will take the user to a website where Java can be downloaded.
            </p>
                
            <p>Apple's Java comes pre-installed on Mac OS X 10.6 and below, but this practice was discontinued beginning with OS X 10.7 (Lion).
                To get the latest Java 7 from Oracle, you will need 10.7.3 or later. If you already have Java 7 installed, you will see a
                Java icon under System Preferences. Java versions 6 and below are listed in the Java Preferences.app located in the
                Applications > Utilities folder on your Mac. <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_mac.xml">This page</a> contains
                more information on how to install and/or update Java for OS X.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Teacher Edition</h5>
            <p>The teacher edition, in which tree-derivation exercises can be shown in
                a presentation mode that automatically computes denotations of nonterminals,
                is available upon request to instructors. Please send an email to:

            <p>The calculator is under active development, and may exhibit unexpected behavior from time to time, especially if you're using one
                of the Beta releases. If you encounter something strange, or would like to see some additional functionality, we're all ears.
                Our bug reports and feature requests are managed through on our <a href="https://github.com/dylnb/LambdaCalculator/issues">Github
                Issues</a> page. Please take a look at the open issues to see
                if your problem has already been reported (and if so, to check the progress on fixing it). You can report new issues or make new
                requests directly through the Issues page, if you have a registered Github account. Otherwise, just shoot us an email
                (<img src="images/email.png" alt="" style="inline; vertical-align:middle;"/>), and we'll create a ticket that you can monitor for updates.
                In either case, include any information you can that will help us reproduce the problem, including exercise files, screenshots, and
                information about your operating system and the version of the calculator that you're using.</p>

            <p><b>For students and instructors:</b> When typing predicate logic
            expressions in the program, some special keyboard combinations are
            used to enter logical symbols. See the <a href="specialsymbols.html">guide
            to entering special symbols</a> for instructions. Some help is also
            provided within the program.</p>
            
            <p><b>For instructors:</b> If you would like to write an exercise file,

            <h3>A Note on Operator Precedence</h3>
            
            <p>The Penn Lambda Calculator lets lambda abstraction take precedence over 
            function application. This is the opposite convention as the one used in 
            Heim and Kratzer (1998). Thanks to Irene Heim for pointing this out.</p> 
            
            <p>For example, our system parses 
            &quot;&lambda;y&lambda;x.[R(x,y)](a)(b)&quot; as &quot;[ [ 
            &lambda;y&lambda;x.R(x,y) ] (a) ] (b)&quot; rather than as &quot;[ 
            &lambda;y [ [&lambda;x.R(x,y)] (a) ] ] (b)&quot;. Specifically, the latter 
            case is ruled out because it would result in the lambda abstraction headed 
            by &lambda;y having as its body an instance of function application, i.e. 
            &quot;[[&lambda;x.R(x,y)] (a) ]&quot;. The same precedence rule holds of 
            variable binders other than lambdas, specifically quantifiers and iota 
            operators.</p>
            
            <p>There is, however, an exception to this rule: Although the relations 
            between atomic predicates and their arguments are semantically interpreted 
            as function application, they nevertheless take precedence over lambda 
            abstraction, and in fact over all other operators. This is so that 
            &quot;&lambda;x.P(x)&quot; is parsed as &quot;&lambda;x.[P(x)]&quot; and 
            not as &quot;[&lambda;x.P](x)&quot;. This also applies to 
            Sch&ouml;nfinkelized 
            predicates; e.g. the expression &quot;&lambda;x.R(x)(a)&quot; is parsed as 
            &quot;&lambda;x.[R(x)(a)]&quot;.
            </p>
